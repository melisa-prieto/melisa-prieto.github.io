           <p>Welcome, Bienvenidx to this space. I am a Toronto- based artist educator and entrepreneur from Bogotá, Colombia, dedicated to celebrating, engaging, and caring for children and youth through play-based arts programming. I believe education and community spaces should strengthen young people’s agency and self-esteem, affirming their identities and creative self-expression. My approach to teaching is rooted in my belief in our collective capacity to organize and effect change in our communities through storytelling, multigenerational education, and honouring the conocimientos (knowledge) and resiliency we bring as we move through borders.

             &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
             &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

           The programming I create is (w)holistic and person-centered to prioritize our wellness and our agency over our bodies. As a multidisciplinary artist, I have been working with ceramics, mask making, sustainable crafts, and creative movement for the past ten years, creating initiatives to engage children as active participants in their artistic education, and parents as guides to enrich children’s self esteem, self-efficacy, and incorporate imagination and play into their parenting.

           In 2016, I co-founded ImaginArte, a community arts initiative created to make space for and amplify children and youth’s voices who are often silenced. Putting intergenerational learning at the core of the programming, young people across generations collaborate and care for each other. Recently, I co-founded a jewellery business that combines handcrafted silver jewellery adornment with conversations about mental health and creative processes that I run with my father. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cecilujewels">Check Us Out!</p></a>
