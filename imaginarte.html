<p> ImaginArte is a community based initiative focused on re-conceptualizing Child Care to center children’s experiences, resilience, creativity, and skills with the aim to rEvolutionize what childcare spaces look like in the city. The name originates from a play on words in Spanish, about imagination, the act of rethinking, redoing, and restructuring possibilities through artistic processes of creation.

Born in 2016, this initiative was inspired from conversations with community artists and educators about the lack of affordable, high quality art programs and child care in Toronto for newcomer, immigrant, and refugee families and children. In 2016, ImaginArte March Break Camp was created to offer support for families and safer spaces for children and youth to learn and play. </p2> </div>

<p> Brings over 80 years of traditional handcrafted metal and stone work from Colombia, passed down by my grandfather and father. As a third generation jewellery artist, I am inspired to remix this knowledge with Adornment, as a way to reclaim our bodies and creativity, sharing stories of migration and movement. 

Cecilu's jewellery carry vibrant natural stones that resemble seeds, plant-life, and earth. Each piece is intentionally made by hand, with the greatest of care for your skin. We value high quality finishes, working with silver and stones to elevate self expression and respect the properties of the materials, ensuring your jewellery will last you forever.
